Revise through code 

Consider day2's Box class 
What will happen , if you write below code in main(...) method ?

Box b1;//desc mem pic
b1=new Box(1,2,3); //desc mem pic
Box b2=new Box(4,5,6);//desc mem pic
b2=b1;//Are there any objs marked for GC ? Yes : 2nd box
b1=null;//Are there any additional objs marked for GC ? no
b2=null;//Are there any additional objs marked for GC ? 
Box b3=new Box(10,20,30);
b3=new Box(11,21,31);//Are there any objs marked for GC ? YES : 10,20,30


Continue with day2's pending sequence

1. Create Cubes
eg : In TestBox 
sop("Enter side of a cube");
Box cube=new Box(sc.nextDouble());

In Box class :
Add overloaded ctor n use ctor chaining

2. Add a method to Box class to compare equality of 2 boxes & test it
Meaning : 2 boxes are same : iff dims are same

eg : In TestBox : 
sop("Enter box 1 dims") //10 20 30
Box b1=new Box(....);
sop("Enter box 2 dims") //20 10 30
Box b2=new Box(....);
sop(b1.isEqual(b2)); //invoker : b1    arg  : b2
//sop(b2.isEqual(b1));

3. Add a method to Box class to return a new Box with modified offset dims & test it with the tester.
eg : Box b1=new Box(...);//10 20 30
sop("enter offsets in dim for creating new box w.r.t earlier box : wOff doff hoff");
If user supplies these offsets :  3 -4 5 
A new box object should be created with dims : 13 16 35
Box earlierBox=new Box(...);//10 20 30
How will you call this method from the tester ?
Box newBox=earlierBox.createNewBox(wOff ,doff, hoff);

Add a method in Box class
Box createNewBox(double wOff ,double doff, double hoff)
{
  //this : earlierBox
  Box myBox=new Box(this.width+wOff,this.width+dOff,this.width+dOff);
  return myBox;
}

In the code below , are there any objs marked for GC ?

earlierBox.createNewBox(wOff ,doff, hoff);

Add a method in Box class
void createNewBox(double wOff ,double doff, double hoff)
{
  //this : earlierBox
  Box myBox=new Box(this.width+wOff,this.width+dOff,this.width+dOff);
 }


4. Enter Packages , classpath n  access specifiers 
Refer to readme : regarding packages.txt
refer : diagrams\Access specifiers.png 
 diagrams\understanding access specifiers

Solve : Modify Box scenario
Add Box class under : com.cdac.core package.
Add TestBox class under : com.cdac.tester package , compile n test it.  


5. Arrays 
Regarding Arrays
refer -- Java Tut slides(shared in day1 help) No  29

In Java, arrays are full-fledged objects. Like objects, arrays are dynamically created & stored on the heap. 

Arrays (like any other object) are  associated with the class. All arrays of the same dimension and type have the same class. 
The length of an array does not play any role in establishing the array's class. 

For example, an array of three ints has the same class as an array of three hundred ints.([I) The length of an array is considered part of its instance data.

eg : The class name for single dimension array of ints is "[I". The class name for a three-dimensional array of bytes is "[[[B". The class name for single dimension array of booleans is "[Z"

Array size(length) is fixed. 

Implicit super class of array is java.lang.Object.


5.1 Create Array of primitive types

Objective -- Accept no of data samples(of type double) from User(using scanner)
Create suitable array & display it using for-loop , to confirm default values.





Accept data from User(scanner) & store it in the array.
Display array data using  for loop.
