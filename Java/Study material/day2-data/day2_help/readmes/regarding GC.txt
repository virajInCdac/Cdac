Regarding garbage collection

Garbage Collection is a process to identify and delete the objects from Heap memory which are not in use. GC frees the space after removing unreferenced objects.

Garbage= un -referencable object.(no of refs =0)

Automatic Gargabe Collection --- to avoid memory. leaks/holes

JVM creates 2 system thrds --- main thrd(to exec main() sequentially) -- foreground thrd
G.C --- daemon thrd ---background thrd --- JVM activates it periodically(only if required)  --- GC releases the memory occupied by un-referenced objects allocated on the heap(the objects whose no. of ref=0) 

How to explicitly request for GC ?
API of System class
public static void gc()
eg : System.gc();//it's simply a REQUEST to JVM , for running GC htread.

Object class API
protected void finalize() throws Throwable
Automatically called by the garbage collector on an object before garbage collection of the object takes place.

Releasing of  non- Java resources.(eg - closing of DB connection, closing file handles,closing socket connections)   is NOT done automatically by GC

Triggers for marking the object for GC(candidate for GC)

1. Nullifying all valid refs.
eg : Box b1=new Box(1,2,3);
Box b2=b1;
b1=b2=null;//how many objs are marked for GC : 1


2. re-assigning the reference to another object
eg : Box b1=new Box(10,20,30);
b1=new Box(2,3,4);




3. Object created within a method & its ref NOT returned to the caller.
4. Island of isolation
