Desc of FileInputStream --- java.io.FileInputStream 
Desc of FileOutputStream --- java.io.FileOutputStream 
--- Stream class to represent unbuffered char data reading from a text file.
String readLine() --- reads data from a buffer in line by line manner-- & rets null at end of Stream condition.
But Scanner is not Buffered Stream
...attach FileInputStream or FileReader
PrintWriter(OutputStream  w) --- can wrap binary o/p stream -- buffering +conversion(char-->binary),no auto-flush option
PrintWriter(OutputStream w , boolean flushOnNewLine) --- 
API Methods----print/println/printf same as in PrintStream class(same type as System.out)
Stream class which represents --- Char o/p stream connected to Text file. --- java.io.FileWriter
Classes --- FileInputStream -- unbuffered bin i/p stream connected to bin file device.
FileOutputStream --unbuffered bin o/p stream connected to bin file device.
API of InputStream class
Important  API of OutputStream
Using BIS(BufferedInputStream) -- enables buffering BUT doesn't provide any advanced API(ie. read(), read(byte[]), read(byte[] b,int off,int len) . Same is true with BOS.(BufferedOutputStream)
java.io.DataOutputStream ---implements DataOutput i/f
Constructor -- DataOutputStream (OutputStream out)
Stream class --- java.io.DataInputStream -- implements DataInput
DataInputStream(InputStream in)
Stream Class for writing Objects to bin. stream
java.io.ObjectOutputStream implements DataOutput,ObjectOutput
Description --- ObjectOutputStream class performs serialization.
ObjectOutputStream(OutputStream out) 
java.io.ObjectInputStream  --- performs de-serialization.--- implements DataInput,ObjectInput
Constructor --- ObjectInputStream(InputStream in)
