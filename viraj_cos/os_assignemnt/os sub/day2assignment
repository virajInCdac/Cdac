echo "Press * for Multiplication"
echo "Press / for Division"
echo "Press e for EXIT"

read -p "n1=> " a
read -p "Op=> " op
read -p "n2=> " b

if [[ $op == + ]]
then
	result=$(( $a+$b ))
elif [[ $op == - ]]
then
	result=$(( $a-$b ))
elif [[ $op == \* ]]
then
	result=$(( $a*$b ))
elif [[ $op == / ]]
then
	result=$(( $a/$b ))

#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter number 1 " no1
read -p "Enter number 2 " no2
read -p "Enter number 3 " no3

if [ $no1 -gt $no2 ] && [ $no1 -gt $no2 ]
then
	echo "$no1 is the largest"
elif [ $no2 -gt $no1 ] && [ $no2 -gt $no3 ]
then
	echo "$no2 is the largest"
elif [ $no3 -gt $no1 ] && [ $no3 -gt $no2 ]
then
	echo "$no3 is the largest"
else
	echo "Numbers equal"
fi
